description:
  content: "<p>This project started out as an exercise to codify the <em>Poker</em> game, which has led down a spiraling path of abstractions to a much more generic card game framework. The current implementation defines the game and cards in such a way so as to support different kinds of card decks, card distribution algorithms, individual card effects and player hand evaluations. The project is not completed, and work on it is ongoing.</p><p>The project is also accompanied by few sample games demonstrating the use of the library - <em>Poker</em>, <em>Blackjack</em>, <em>Rock Paper Scissor</em>.</p>"

challenge:
  content: "<p>The most complicated part of this project has been to define the interfaces and classes well enough to allow for the definition of as many varied card games as possible. It remains to be seen if the current structure is robust enough to do so or not as only a handful examples have been implemented.</p>"

features:
  - feature: "Configurable card deck definition"
  - feature: "Card definitions that let us find which card has a higher value"
  - feature: "Customizable card distribution pattern"
  - feature: "Example games - Poker, Blackjack, Rock Paper Scissor"
  - feature: "Game utility types - Players, Match, Game, etc."
  - feature: "Unit testing for the sample games to validate functionality of the library"
