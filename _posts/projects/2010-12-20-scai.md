description:
  content: "<p>AI controller for a real-time strategy (RTS) game requires several AI techniques to work together at all times such as unit level controllers and overall strategy controllers. In application, RTS bots have a reputation for being extremely predictable and hence, human players find them very easy to beat. In this project, our group decided to create several different kinds of AI controllers for <em>Starcraft: Brood War</em> game. My role on the project was to evolve a unit controller (using Genetic Algorithm) that would be able to control any unit in the game (except controlling special spell-casting powers).</p>"

challenge:
  content: "<p>Customized AI controller code (written using <em>BWAPI</em>) is injected into the game through an application called <em>Chaoslauncher</em>. This involved learning how the game represented different kind of data elements (attack speed, unit movement speed, armor, damage, etc.) as well as how to interface with the API. The biggest challenge however was the nature of tests to be carried out. The GA process depends on rating each chromosome, which meant that the game had to be run several thousand times to do a complete Neuro Evolution process, which highlightâ€™s the need for efficient memory management.</p>"

features:
  - feature: "BWAPI based unit manager"
  - feature: "CSV data reader/writer for recording samples and test data"
  - feature: "Compilation of C++ code into static libraries"
  - feature: "DLL injection into the game via Chaoslauncher"
