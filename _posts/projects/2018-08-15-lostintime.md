description:
  content: "<p>Lost in Time was a TV show in Norway that aired in April 2017 with a companion app for viewers to play along. It was culmination of a family of technologies that allowed the production of tightly coupled products for television broadcasting.</p><p>In the show, contestants compete with each other by playing mixed reality games for a prize pool. These mixed reality games had physical controllers for digital games and were captured in a green room.</p><p>When the show aired, players at home could join and compete for a prize pool that would be equal to the episode's prize pool. Both the show and the apps had 4 games types, with each themed for 6 distinct era themes. Both the mobile app/games and the studio interactive games were made in Unreal Engine 4.</p>"

challenge:
  content: "<p>The project was done in a relatively short time, by a startup. This meant the biggest difficulty with this project was figuring out the details of the workflow while being in the thick of it. The short timelines also meant the product was often very untested, which eventually turned out to let the product down.</p>"
