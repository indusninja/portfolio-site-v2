description:
  content: "<p>Don't Panic is a two-player co-operative platform puzzle game, which was developed during the Nordic Game Jam 2012. Each player controls a robot in the game whose primary resource is electric energy, which is used for movement.</p><p>However, even staying idle saps some energy from the robots. So, effectively players have only a certain amount of time to finish each level. In order to mediate the effects of losing energy, players can pick up the radiant balls (energy cores) in the level. This ball recharges the robot holding it, but doesn't stop charging it past its maximum capacity either. This means prolonged exposure of the ball can destroy the robot.</p><p>Both players have to work together in order to overcome such challenges presented in the level to reach end of the level.</p>"

challenge:
  content: "<p>As a game, the final product has very few levels and most of them can get players stuck without any chance to reset. However, the team did run through developing a large amount ofpuzzle mechanics that can be combined into several permutations by level designers to build interesting levels. Hence, while we failed to create an engaging game, we were able to create a toolset for level designers.</p>"
