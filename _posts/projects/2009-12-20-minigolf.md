description:
  content: "<p>Mini-golf is a single-player game where players have to clear a sequence of holes on the course. Playerâ€™s aim is to clear each hole in the minimum number of shots they can. This project's objective was to familiarize myself with OpenGL.</p>"

challenge:
  content: "<p>The biggest challenge in this project by far was its physics components. While I was able to get a respectable response system in place, the effort it took to fine-tune the physical responses took too much time and eventually affected the work put into the rendering components.</p><p>Some of the functionalities that were planned for the future are things like animation and shader support along with support for a third party physics engine. However this project is now defunct and I will plan to revisit the topic in a new project in the future - hopefully with a better architecture.</p>"
