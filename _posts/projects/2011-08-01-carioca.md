description:
  content: "<p>Carioca is a first person RPG which was an experiment about how player interaction with the environment can be used to drive the game's narrative and environment.</p><p>The game takes place in a working class environment where resources are tight. The environment has certain resources that easier to come by like rest, but many others that are not - food, entertainment, etc.</p><p>In order to keep themselves fulfilled, players can either try to work hard, or they can intimidate NPCs. The goals are not imposed, and neither is the method to achieve them - player decides how they will interact with this environment. And depending on those choices, the environment's visual cues change accordingly.</p><p>For example, intimidate too many people and that district's theme gets darker, and the intimidated people flock to the trash piles more to make ends meet. On the other hand, if you are nicer to the NPCs, then they will be friendlier and might help you out as friends. In such a case, as no apparent violence happens and everyone has enough to make ends meet, the environment looks nice and hospitable.</p>"

challenge:
  content: "<p>While the Unreal Engine provides loads of functionality for the programmers, some of its foundation features were not accessible in the free version (UDK). At times this lack of access hampered us in understanding the optimal workflow process and loopholes that need to be avoided. One such problem I faced was regarding the use of Navigation Meshes. In the best case scenario, the navigation mesh would work in case of controlling one AI bot. However, when more bots were introduced, the procedure would end up returning an error state for the navigation method. This is an outstanding error and a migration to waypoint based navigation method might come up with better results.</p><p>Another big challenge was the use of Scaleform based bot action symbols. Since our development team was highly restricted in its animation skills, some method had to be devised to illustrate the bot’s actions to the player. The solution was to render SWF (Flash) texture on a dynamically spawned static actor over the bot’s head.</p>"
